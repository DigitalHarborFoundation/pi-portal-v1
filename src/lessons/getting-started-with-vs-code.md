## What is VS Code?

During this course you’re going to be using VS Code, a free and powerful editor developed and maintained by Microsoft's open source team.

## File Management and Text Editors

Knowing how to work with a text editor and manage files is an important piece of web development. Many e-learning platforms that teach web development often don’t integrate this piece, and this creates some difficulty when transitioning into practical development. In this course, you’ll be practicing these concepts from the beginning.

## Using a Text Editor

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are plain text files that have specific file extensions: .html, .css, and .js. There are several text editors out there, and you’ll want to use one that you’re most comfortable with. One key thing to consider is a syntax highlighting feature. All professional level text editors will have syntax highlighting.

One of the best features of VS Code is that it is highly customizable and highly responsive. Over the past two years there has been a widespread adoption of VS Code in the developer community. This means that there is a wealth of extensions for VS Code, so you’re likely to be able to find any additional features that you need.

Your Raspberry Pi should have VS Code installed already.

## File Management

You’re going to want to develop a consistent system for managing the folders and files for each new project. One of the best ways to do this is to create one folder for the course and then a sub-folder for each project. You’ll be creating one main page for this course, so you should make sure to have at least one additional sub-folder.

### Setting Up Your Directories

If you’re comfortable with using the command line, you can complete this process very quickly within terminal. However, command line instruction isn’t in the scope of this course so unless you already have that skill-set it won’t be covered. This lesson will include resources on learning basic command line skills if you’re interested in pursuing it, but you’re also perfectly able to do this from the Finder window.

## Working with a Text Editor

Once your file system is set up, go ahead and open up your text editor. These examples use VS Code, but if you use another editor for some of your future web development there will be slight distinctions but the general concepts will be similar.

### Steps:

Open VS Code and go to File->Open. This image shows the course folder on the Desktop. Navigate to the folder and open it in Atom.
