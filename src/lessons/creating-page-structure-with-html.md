## Objectives and Overview
Once you have an understanding of the basic HTML tags and elements, the next area of focus is creating page structures with HTML. This lesson includes examples of basic HTML layouts, however you should use these as inspiration and always let content needs guide your layout and structure.

### Lesson Objectives

- Understand how to use the HTML anchor `<a>` tag to link to another webpage.
- Explain the structure of the HTML anchor tag and how itâ€™s used to create hyperlinks.
- Demonstrate the ability to add links to a webpage by linking to another page using the anchor tag.

## Page Structure Overview

The elements covered in this lesson are all contained within the page **body**. Let's take a look at some HTML as a starting point:

[html photo]

The photo is broken into two separate sections: the **head** and the **body**. The head contains important data about your site, and also includes links to stylesheets. The body contains the actual page content that is rendered and displayed to the user. 

## Head Section

## Body Section

## Structural Elements

The elements covered in this section are used to provide page structure. There are general purpose structural elements that don't have an associated meaning and there are specific elements that have meaning. One isn't better than the other -- you'll use a mix of both while writing HTML. The important piece is to know **when** and **why** to use each element.

The two general purpose structural elements are ```<div>``` and ```<span>```. 

### Div Element

### Span Element


## Readability and Semantic HTML Elements

In addition to structuring the content, these elements are used to provide meaning about the content. This is known as *semantic HTML*. Prior to HTML5, web developers relied entirely on the ```<div>``` element and added classes to indicate meaning. For example, prior to the introduction of the ```<header>``` element, it was common to see code such as ```<div class="header">``` and ```<div class="footer">``` throughout the HTML.

There are 13 semantic HTML elements.  

### Header Element

### Main Element

### Nav Element

### Aside Element

### Section

### Article

### Footer Element
