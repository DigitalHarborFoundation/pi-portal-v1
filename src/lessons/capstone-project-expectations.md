## Project Prompt

The prompt for the project is straight forward: Create a website with _at least 3 pages_ that is hosted and served by your Raspberry Pi. The content can be about anything you like as long it's appropriate and meets the project requirements.

### Specific Project Requirements

## Tips and Best Practices

One of the most important things to consider for your project is the scope. It’s better to plan something that’s smaller scale and then build from there once you make some progress. Remember a crucial part of the Design Process is the willingness to accept and integrate feedback. Keep this in mind when receiving any suggestions from program staff!

Remember to have a solid understanding of scope. It’s a good idea to break your project into smaller components if you’re having trouble moving forward.

## Progress Updates

In a Progress Update post on your portfolio website, you will be writing about the progress you are making on a specific project. This is to share the new things you are learning as you work through your project and to update your readers about your progress. A Progress Update post is written while a project is still being worked on.

When you write a Progress Update, here are a few guiding questions you can answer:

What project is this a part of?
What progress have you made?
What new learning have you done since your previous update?
What do you plan to do next?

REMEMBER:

Take screenshots, photos, and / or videos!
You can create screenshots and take photos or videos to document your project as you’re working as well as upload the final product. This is a good skill to practice as you’ll want to get in the habit of documenting a project as you’re working on it. Also, feel free to take pictures of any sketches that you’ve done in your Maker Notebook!
Activity: Progress Update
Make sure that your proposal has been reviewed and that you did the first blog entry.
Create the Progress Update Post and begin writing it. You can do this like a daily journal if you want: Each project day can be a new section within the same entry.
Start making!
Generally, at the end of the day get into the habit of updating your blog post. This is a solid and maintainable workflow for the project.
