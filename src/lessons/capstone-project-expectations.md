## Objectives and Overview

Once you have an understanding of the basic HTML tags and elements, the next area of focus is creating page structures with HTML. This lesson includes examples of basic HTML layouts, however you should use these as inspiration and always let content needs guide your layout and structure.

### Lesson Objectives

- Review the expectations and requirements for the capstone project.

## Project Prompt

Please read this entire section before starting!

The prompt for the project is straight forward: Create a website with _at least 3 pages_ that is hosted and served by your Raspberry Pi. The content can be about anything you like as long it's appropriate and meets the project requirements.

### Specific Skill Requirements

The capstone project needs to meet the following requirements:

- At least 3 separate pages
- Each page must be linked to a CSS stylesheet
- Each page must use the following structural elements:
  - Header
  - Main
  - Nav
  - Footer
- Include the following elements on any page, where appropriate:
  - Headings
  - Paragraphs
  - Lists (ordered or unordered)
  - Images
  - External and internal links
- Your page must be hosted and served on your Raspberry Pi

## Tips and Best Practices

One of the most important things to consider for your project is the scope. It’s better to plan something that’s smaller scale and then build from there once you make some progress. Remember a crucial part of the design process is the willingness to accept and integrate feedback. Keep this in mind when receiving any suggestions from peers and facilitators!

If you're having trouble or stuck, it's often helpful to break your project into smaller components. For example, if you're having trouble thinking about what content to add to your page, focus some time on styling your navigation. 

Remember that this is meant to be an introduction to web development and the Raspberry Pi. While it's great to look to web pages that you like for inspiration, try to not be hard on yourself! There's *much more* HTML and CSS out there! Use this project as an opportunity to build your foundation. 

<!-- ## Progress Updates

In a Progress Update post on your portfolio website, you will be writing about the progress you are making on a specific project. This is to share the new things you are learning as you work through your project and to update your readers about your progress. A Progress Update post is written while a project is still being worked on.

When you write a Progress Update, here are a few guiding questions you can answer:

What project is this a part of?
What progress have you made?
What new learning have you done since your previous update?
What do you plan to do next?

REMEMBER:

Take screenshots, photos, and / or videos!
You can create screenshots and take photos or videos to document your project as you’re working as well as upload the final product. This is a good skill to practice as you’ll want to get in the habit of documenting a project as you’re working on it. Also, feel free to take pictures of any sketches that you’ve done in your Maker Notebook!
Activity: Progress Update
Make sure that your proposal has been reviewed and that you did the first blog entry.
Create the Progress Update Post and begin writing it. You can do this like a daily journal if you want: Each project day can be a new section within the same entry.
Start making!
Generally, at the end of the day get into the habit of updating your blog post. This is a solid and maintainable workflow for the project. -->
