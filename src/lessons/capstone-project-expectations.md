Part Two: Capstone Project Work
Now that you’ve planned your project and showed your proposal to the program staff for review, it’s time to move on to the next stages of the Design Process: Prototyping and Making! You’ll have plenty of time to work on your project while at the Tech Center, but if there is anything you’d like additional time with feel free to work at home as well.

Remember to have a solid understanding of scope. It’s a good idea to break your project into smaller components if you’re having trouble moving forward.

Project Work
This is an ongoing phase and will be the bulk of the time spent on the Capstone Project. While these projects are individual, it’s a great idea to fully utilize your peer community by constantly getting (and offering) feedback that can then be integrated into your process. This is especially helpful if you find yourself at a point where you’re stuck!

This phase is when you’ll be starting and maintaining your second blog post for the Capstone Project. This post will be an ongoing entry that you’ll add to each day until you finish. The format for this is the Progress Update Post.

Progress Update
In a Progress Update post on your portfolio website, you will be writing about the progress you are making on a specific project. This is to share the new things you are learning as you work through your project and to update your readers about your progress. A Progress Update post is written while a project is still being worked on.

When you write a Progress Update, here are a few guiding questions you can answer:

What project is this a part of?
What progress have you made?
What new learning have you done since your previous update?
What do you plan to do next?
REMEMBER:

Take screenshots, photos, and / or videos!
You can create screenshots and take photos or videos to document your project as you’re working as well as upload the final product. This is a good skill to practice as you’ll want to get in the habit of documenting a project as you’re working on it. Also, feel free to take pictures of any sketches that you’ve done in your Maker Notebook!
Activity: Progress Update
Make sure that your proposal has been reviewed and that you did the first blog entry.
Create the Progress Update Post and begin writing it. You can do this like a daily journal if you want: Each project day can be a new section within the same entry.
Start making!
Generally, at the end of the day get into the habit of updating your blog post. This is a solid and maintainable workflow for the project.
