## Linking Between Pages

You've now created a single HTML page and you may be wondering how to connect multiple pages together. This is the next step in the learning process: linking multiple pages. This need arises any time that you're working on a site that has more than one page, which is very likely to happen. In fact you'll be creating a three page site within this course! Let's review the linking process and practice this crucial skill.

## Review: The Anchor Element

Recall that hyperlinks are what connect web pages together. The anchor, or `<a>` tag, is used to define the links between pages. Anchors can connect to a particular part of a page, between different pages in a site, or connect to outside resources.

You've encountered these links since they're a crucial backbone of the internet. The anchor element is used to connect pages together and is a crucial HTML element.

Browsers typically render links as having blue text and an underline, but this isn't always the case because this appearance can be changed with CSS. Let's take a look at a hyperlink:

```html
<a href="https://digitalharbor.org"
  >Link to the Digital Harbor Foundation Website</a
>
```

Let's now look at the structure of the HTML:

- **Element:** anchor element
- **Attribute:** href
- **Value:** https://digitalharbor.org
- **Tags:** `<a>` and `</a>`

"Link to the Digital Harbor Foundation Website" is displayed as the link text. When constructing a link, this text is placed between the opening and closing anchor tags. The user would click on this text and be taken to the page linked in the _href value_. In this case, the link would go to the [Digital Harbor Foundation Website](https://digitalharbor.org).
