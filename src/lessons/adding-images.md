## Img Element

The `<img>` element is like anchors (`<a>`) in that it behaves differently from other tags in regard to opening/closing tags.

Take a look at the Thimble screenshot above. The opening tag is actually “<img “ which closes at the end with “>” Contained within the open img tag is the description and the image url. The description is defined by:

alt=”Image description”

This is included within the entirely of the img tag. The alt description shows up if the image is unable to be viewed. Make sure to get in the habit of including this in all images you place on your website.

The src stands for “source” and is the url link to the image. If the url is entered incorrectly or is a bad link, the image won’t properly display. The url must go in quotation marks. After the alt and src are included, the img tag should be closed with a “>” Note that you don’t need to do “/>” for images.

You may have noticed that your image is larger than you wanted. See if you can figure out a solution for this!
