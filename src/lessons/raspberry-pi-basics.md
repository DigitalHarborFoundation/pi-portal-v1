## Objectives and Overview

This lesson introduces the Raspberry Pi and provides an overview of some of the strengths of the tool. Part of understanding the particular strengths is to understand when not to use it, so the lesson includes a comparison of a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. Since the Pi is such a flexible tool, the lesson concludes with some example projects using a Raspberry Pi.

### Lesson Objectives

- Become familiar with the Raspberry Pi and identify the strengths of the tool.
- Understand and explain the differences between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino (and other microcontrollers).
- Recognize example projects that use a Raspberry Pi.

### CSTA Standards

- **2-IC-20** - Compare tradeoffs associated with computing technologies that affect people's everyday activities and career options.

### What is a Raspberry Pi?

A Raspberry Pi is a small, \$35 credit card sized computer that runs the Linux operating system. These powerful computers are flexible enough to be the backbone of a variety of projects ranging from webservers to vintage arcade systems.

## Raspberry Pi Comparisons: Arduino

If you’ve seen or used an Arduino, you may be wondering the core differences between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. On the surface it may seem as if they’re the same thing, especially considering the variety of projects that both can power.

The core difference is that the Arduino is a microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi is more like a computer. An Arduino can be programmed to run a single program repeatedly, while a Raspberry Pi can run multiple programs even at the same time.

Let’s look at some use cases when you’d want to use a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino.

### When to Use a Raspberry Pi?

You may be thinking that the Raspberry Pi is more powerful than an Arduino since it can run more programs and act more like a computer. This isn’t necessarily the case -- as with any other tool, it’s all about knowing when and how to use each it!

Arduinos are highly effective for repetitive tasks such as powering a motor, reading temperature settings, or controlling a sequence of LEDs. Arduinos are often used as the control board for 3D printers since the printers run a specific program over and over.

Raspberry Pi is effective when you need a smaller version of a computer. For example, you could use a Pi to power a webserver, power a vintage arcade system, or when you need to run a variety of programs at once.

This article from Make Magazine (https://makezine.com/2015/12/04/admittedly-simplistic-guide-raspberry-pi-vs-arduino/) has a great summary of the decision process. Basically, think about the functionality of your project, and then if you can describe the functionality with “less than two ‘and’s” you should use an Arduino. Even though the article is a few years old, check it out for more information and examples.

## Raspberry Pi Project Examples

This section contains projects that are powered by a Raspberry Pi. These are all quite different -- this demonstrates the flexibility and power of the Raspberry Pi. Let’s take a look a deeper look!
